<h3><span style = "color:mediumSeaGreen;border:1px solid black">PROJECTS : </span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teachers and Student Information Repository: </strong><br>
The purpose of this project is to provide a single source of individual teacher-student records so that 
we can easily track and manage unlimited teachers and students data to eliminate the communication gap of 
teachers and students. Here I develop this application by using  Android Studio. I use XML for front end development
and  Java as back end development. Also use the SQLite database for providing the teachers and Students Information.</li>
<li><strong>Human Rescue Bot : </strong>A team Project done by 5 person under one of our respective teacher.“A rescue robot is 
a robot that has been designed for the purpose of rescuing people.<br>
 Common situations that employ rescue robots are  mining accidents or earth quake. The benefits of rescue robots to these 
 operations include reduced personnel requirements, reduced fatigue, and mostly, access to unreachable areas.”Here we use the 
 arduino uno microcontroller board with three ultrasonic sonar sensor those can sense the existence of object. Human detection 
 is achieved via mlx thermo sensor.</li></ul>
